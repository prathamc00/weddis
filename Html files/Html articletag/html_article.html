Everything confirmed in the GTA 6 leak, including setting, characters, and combat
<br>
An enormous batch of leaked GTA 6 footage has appeared online, confirming numerous details about the much-anticipated crimefest.

<br>
Spanning a huge array of work-in-progress gameplay, the leaked footage hands us our first glimpse of GTA 6 in action â€“ albeit in a completely unpolished state. Gunplay and other gameplay features are shown, while character and setting details are hinted at within the environment.

All of it is very much unfinished. Overlaid with debugging information and technical metrics, the footage is clearly taken from an in-progress build of the game. But it is genuine. Rockstar confirmed the leaked footage is authentic and asked that many of the videos and screenshots shared across social media be taken down.
